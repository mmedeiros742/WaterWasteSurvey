# WaterWasteSurvey

A project requested by the Office of Sustainability of University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth in order
to find ways to reduce water consumption of the students. It would be a survey that aimed to
understand the showering habits of both on campus and commuter students. The survey was
conducted in 3 phases, with each phase increasing the amount of students that were to be surveyed.
With the collected responses, the answers from each person asked would be translated to numerical
forms in order to allow it to be considered more implementable into Python. The data was then
analyzed with the Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy libraries. The results were then presented to members
of the Office of Sustainability.

Tools Used: Python (Libraries: Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas), Google Forms, Google Docs
